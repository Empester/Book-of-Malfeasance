# Book of Malfeasance
Publich "Book" of **mostly** all genocides/mass murder events done by different countries.

## Quick Start
Follow these simple steps and you are ready to go in less than one minute!

### 1. This project is **FAR** from being done.
The project has potential, so that's why I decided to make it public. It's little to no CSS, the indentation is incredibly fucked and some informations will need to be fact-checked.

### 2. I'm a trash dev
Like I said the site looks horrible. However it's made public so people can contribute to it by adding information to it or make a better CSS.

### 3. How to add country pngs to my text?
To add a flag to an element, add class `fi` followed by `fi-[COUNTRYCODE]`. Example:

```html
<i class="fi fi-se"></i>
```
